HOW TO USE CUSTOM MODELS
------------------------

Any DynOS model pack (from the PC port) should work fine with Saturn.

Models created with Saturn may support custom textures. Find them in packs/<ModelFolder>/expressions/ ...

Just a friendly reminder - if you use someone else's model in a video, it's good etiquette to credit them when possible!

By default, Saturn comes with two models - Shadow Mario and CmtSPARK Mario.
Both presets provide an example of how custom models can be used.
