# Saturn: Custom Maps Edition

- This fork of Saturn makes it so you can use maps from Project64 in Saturn.
- **Saturn** is an all-in-one machinima studio for *Super Mario 64*, based on [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex).
- *In order to compile the editor, a prior copy of the game is required. This is to avoid including any copyrighted material.*
- If you want to learn how to port maps yourself, I suggest you go to [the wiki](https://github.com/GlitchyMarioMario64/Saturn-Custom-Maps/wiki/Porting-Maps-Yourself)
- If you want to learn more about Saturn, I suggest you go to: [Saturn](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn)
